WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 8 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_13_n_0. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_13, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_15, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_27, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_29, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_33, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_44, W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_54, and W1/uncore/uart/u/LSR[7]_i_64.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net W1/hart/ebu/busreg/q_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin W1/hart/ebu/busreg/NextBusState_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell W1/hart/ebu/busreg/NextBusState_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
